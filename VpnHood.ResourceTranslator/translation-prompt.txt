Translate to target language then simplify and improve for marketing.

Rules:
- Preserve placeholders exactly as-is: tokens in curly braces like {x}, {name}, {minutes}.
- Preserve HTML tags, entities, and attributes exactly (do not translate tags or attribute names).
- Preserve punctuation, Markdown, and capitalization style when appropriate.
- Keep URLs and domains unchanged.
- Return ONLY the translated string without quotes or extra commentary.
- If the text is already a URL or looks untranslatable, return it unchanged.
- Return * to skip translation for an item
